<p>Hi. I&#8217;m a starter theme called <code>_s</code>, or <code>underscores</code>, if you like. I&#8217;m a theme meant for hacking so don&#8217;t use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for.</p>

<p>My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you&#8217;re designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you&#8217;ll find here:</p>

<ul>
<li>A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.</li>
<li>A helpful 404 template.</li>
<li>A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.</li>
<li>Custom template tags in inc/template-tags that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.</li>
<li>Some small tweaks in /inc/extras.php that can improve your theming experience.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js. It’s enqueued in functions.php.</li>
<li>A script at js/small-menu.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It’s enqueued in functions.php.</li>
<li>5 sample CSS layouts in /layouts: Two sidebars on the left, two sidebars on the right, a sidebar on either side of your content, and two-column layouts with sidebars on either side.</li>
<li>Smartly organized starter CSS in style.css that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.</li>
<li>The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your <code>_s</code> based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the &#8220;Generate&#8221; button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.</p>

<p>If you want to set things up manually, download <code>_s</code> from github. The first thing you want to do is copy the <code>_s</code> directory and change the name to something else — Like, say, <code>megatherium</code> — then you&#8217;ll need to do a three-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.</p>

<ol>
<li>Search for <code>'_s'</code> (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.</li>
<li>Search for <code>_s_</code> to capture all the function names.</li>
<li>Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.</li>
<li>Search for <code>_s-</code> to capture prefixed handles.</li>
</ol>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Search for: <code>'_s'</code> and replace with: <code>'megatherium'</code></li>
<li>Search for: <code>_s_</code> and replace with: <code>megatherium_</code></li>
<li>Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code></li>
<li>Search for: <code>_s-</code> and replace with: <code>megatherium-</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.</p>

<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to go! The next step is easy to say but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
